--Readme document for *Jonathan Chau*, *chaujt1@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

At least one image, with descriptive alt attribute(s) - several images were used throughout the portfolio with alt attributes. 
Appropriate headings and paragraph text - thoroughly used. 
Links to external page(s) - combined with custom icons and buttons. 
Multiple pages, with appropriate navigation between them - complemented with a navigation bar.
Semantic HTML tags like aside or footer - tags such as footer, section, main, and header were used. 
Adding custom icons from Google Material Icons, Font Awesome, or similar - combined with links to external pages. 


(b) CSS features

Modifying padding and margins to indent content and enhance readability - padding and margins were used to make the interface look cleaner. 
Modifying link, text color, or other colors to be visually appealing, perhaps with one of the pallette creators in the resources tab - various monochrome colors and images were used to create visually appealing pages. 
Leveraging Bootstrap CSS helpers such as image shapes and table layouts to display content in a more interesting manner - Bootstrap CSS helpers were used specifically in the Projects page.
Adding custom font(s) from Google fonts to add more personality (make sure to include appropriate fallbacks) - a custom font is used throughout the portfolio. 


(c) Advanced features

Creating a more complex page layout, such as including a sidebar or navigation bar - a well designed navigation bar allows access to different pages of the portfolio
A contact form which leverages HTML forms - an HTML form is used to supply a contact form for the portfolio. 


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

With my HTML pages, there were no known problems or likely problems with any files according to AChecker. Potential problems often arose from the use of pictures that have proper
alt-text and visibility. Other potential problems included checking for headings and labels, predictability, readibility, navigatibility, and adaptability. The specific standards ACheck
brought up are adequately satisfied by the design and implementation of my HTML and CSS files.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
About 10 hours. 


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
AChecker, W3C HTML and W3C CSS, Google Fonts, Font Awesome Icons, Bootstrap, CodeAcademy HTML and CSS. Assisted with GitHub Copilot auto-completing code.


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
No other classmates or individuals were consulted as part of this assignment.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
The repository is organized into folders to emphasize neatness. HTML pages are in the pages folder, assets such as images, pdfs, and bootstrap data is stored in the public folder. CSS sheets are in the styles folder, and all the screenshots for validation are in the validation folder. The routing for HTML pages use these folders in mind. Live Server was used to run the HTML pages in the browser.
